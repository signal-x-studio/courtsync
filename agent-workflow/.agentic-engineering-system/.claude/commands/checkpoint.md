Create a checkpoint summary for the completed feature:
1. Summarize what was accomplished
2. List files created/modified
3. Report quality check status
4. Show metrics (LOC, files changed, tests)
5. Note any issues or technical debt
6. Prepare for next feature

Use the checkpoint template from .agent-os/templates/checkpoint-template.md
