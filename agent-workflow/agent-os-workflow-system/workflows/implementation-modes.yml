# CLI Usage Examples

usage_examples:
  # Use default mode from config
  - command: "/agent-os:implement-spec"
    mode: "Uses config.yml default_mode or auto-selects based on project profile"

  # Explicit mode override
  - command: "/agent-os:implement-spec --mode=direct"
    mode: "Forces direct implementation mode regardless of defaults"

  - command: "/agent-os:implement-spec --mode=selective"
    mode: "Forces selective delegation mode"

  - command: "/agent-os:implement-spec --mode=thorough"
    mode: "Forces thorough multi-agent mode"

  # Phase-specific mode override
  - command: "/agent-os:implement-spec --phase=3 --mode=direct"
    mode: "Uses direct mode only for Phase 3, other phases use defaults"

  # Auto-select with project context
  - command: "/agent-os:implement-spec --auto"
    mode: "Analyzes task complexity and selects appropriate mode automatically"

# Migration Guide for Existing Specs

migration:
  status: "All existing specs use thorough mode by default"
  recommendation: |
    For specs in progress (like Innovation Implementation):
    - Phase 1: Already complete (thorough mode) ✓
    - Phase 2: Already complete (thorough mode) ✓
    - Phase 3: Switch to direct mode (microinteractions/polish)
    - Phase 4: Use selective mode (3D work needs delegation for complex tasks)

  backward_compatibility: |
    Existing task-assignments.yml files remain valid.
    New workflow-config.yml is optional.
    If workflow-config.yml is absent, defaults to thorough mode.
