### State Management Strategy
- **Local State:** Use React hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`) for component state
- **Shared State:** Use Context API for role and coverage plan (optional)
- **Persistence:** localStorage for plan, preferences, scores, and claims
- **Real-Time Sync:** BroadcastChannel API for cross-tab communication, localStorage polling
- **Future:** Consider Zustand or Redux if state becomes complex

### Performance Considerations
- Memoize expensive calculations (`useMemo`)
- Debounce filter inputs
- Lazy load analytics (only calculate when panel is open)
- Virtualize long lists if needed (react-window)

---

## Testing Strategy
